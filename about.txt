The Imaginary Institute provides a space to adress the topics and questions not normally dealt with within the boundries of individual disciplines.
What is the nature of knowledge? What is the future of the human species and their planet? How should we live our lives?
How may different fields of human discourse collaborate and stimulate each other?

The Imaginary Institute is an experiment


The Imaginary Institute is an ad-hoc community of open-minded individuals from all walks of life. We aim to create an open space for conversation and collaboration through which we can (re)imagine our social whole. The Institute operates at the intersection of art, science, philosophy, technology, politics, mathematics, design and more. We do this because we believe the questions that lie beyond the boundaries of a single discipline are the ones that are important to ask. To do this we must be prepared to ask ourselves big questions, to be puzzled, amazed, and filled with wonder. We must be prepared to look beyond boundaries, to experiment and to play. Answers will come when we least expect them to.
